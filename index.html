    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>Born and raised in Winter Park, FL. I currently work at UPS as a pickoff sorting packages into trucks. I am married with a 2 year daughter whom is the love of my life.
        I have always enjoyed the ability to be able to create and have my ideas be reflected in something that will last.
    </p>

    <p>I am learning coding through UCF Coding Bootcamp in an effort to change careers into something I enjoy doing. I look forward to learning as much as I can through this
        course so that I can better myself in the future.
